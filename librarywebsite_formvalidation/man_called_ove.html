            </div><br>
            <p>Ove Lindahl, a 59-year-old widower, lives in a townhouse neighborhood where he once chaired the association until his friend Rune replaced him. Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her.<br><br>


            After sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news.<br><br>
            
            In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Parvaneh's persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning. As he drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of "the Whiteshirts" trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to   Ove losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree.<br><br>
            
            In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help.</p>
